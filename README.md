# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

## Big O
### Problem with time measurements
1. Timing code performance varies between machines
2. The same machine will record different times
3. For fast algorithms, speed measurement may not be precise enough

### Problem with counting operations
1. Operations vary with every extra loop
2. Number of operations grows roughly proportionally with every extra loop and is therefor not an exact figure

### Introducing Big O
